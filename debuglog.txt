--------------------
DEBUG LOG 3.1:

X nothing is being updated in the OS after doing make dep and sudo make
  (Kevin)
  * warning compiler said after sudo make execution was 
  * cp: cannot remove ‘./mp3.img’: Text file busy
  ~ 10 mins
  ~ algorithmic, was not closing test_debug when executing make commands
    (Kevin)

X divide by zero exception is not triggered
  (Kevin)
  ~ 20 min, 1 line change
  ~ algorithmic, did not change present bit to 1 for idt entry

X keyboard outputting wrong values per key press
  (Kevin)
  ~ 30 mins, 3 line change
  ~ algorithmic, misunderstood keyboard documentation

X rtc handler does not execute
  (Kevin)
  ~ 1 hour, 20 line change
  ~ algorithmic, had to use inline assembly to wrap rtc handler

X "Enabling Interrupts" won't print after page_init
  (Alexandra)
  * when stepping thru in gdb everything looks fine
  * the print statement runs and sti() runs, just no text shows up
  ~ 1 hours, 1 line change
  ~ algorithmic, wrong video memory address
  (Ben)

X pic not sending correct EOI 
  (Jack)
  ~15 minutes, 2 line changes
  ~algorithmic, had to change number that was being written as well as 
  adding always sending a signal to the master port
  (Kevin)

X boot looping
  (Ben)
  ~ 3 hours, 50 line change
  ~ doing page initialization in wrong order,
    have to load directory first, then enable paging,
    also had to change the assembly functions
  (Ben)
--------------------

--------------------
DEBUG LOG 3.2:

X frequency of RTC off 
  (Kevin)
  * weird frequency when testing the read and write and open functions
  ~ 2 hours, 1 line change
  ~ algorithmic, did not initialize count variable in the log function
  ~ assumed it would be initialized to 0
  (Kevin)

X scroll down visual bug
  (Ben)
  * Bottom line didn't clear properly when scroll down happens, filled bottom line with null
  ~ 15 minutes, 4 line change
  ~ Algorithmic, didn't fill proper memory locations, for loop bounds were wrong
  (Ben)

X Backspace cursor lagging
  (Ben)
  * When backspace happens, cursor wouldn't update until next key pressed
  ~ 2 minutes, 1 line change
  ~ Algorithmic, didn't call update cursor function right after backspace changed scroll x 
  (Ben)

X Enter button didn't work
  (Ben)
  * User could press enter multiple times even when waiting for terminal read
  ~ 20 minutes, 1 line change
  ~ Algorithmic, didn't check for enter flag before enter character sequence
  (Ben)

X read_data is not reading anything, returns 0 bytes
  (Alexandra)
  * first fixed for loop so that will read 1st block
  * still issues with j and length
    * length is CHAR length
    * every index in block is 1 char (4096 chars total)
  ~ 15 mins, 10 line change
  ~ algorithmic, have to account for block offset in 1st block
  (Alexandra)

X sometimes get page_fault even before actual reading
  (Alexandra)
  * issue with the strlen in test (happens when len = 24)
  * cannot use null dentry when opening file
  * read dentry can't assign using null pointer
  ~ 20 mins, 1 line change
  ~ need to initialize dentry pointer before passing it
  (Alexandra)

X Backspace possible even before start of user entered space
  (Ben)
  * It was possible to delete previous information displayed to the screen even
    before the user was supposed to be able to type into the terminal
  ~ 5 minutes, 1 line change
  ~ Algorithmic, fixed by checking against first location of keyboard buffer so that it 
    couldn't go before the zero index of keyboard buffer

X Enter possible even before terminal read previous keyboard buffer
  * It was possible for the user to print the new line character by clicking enter even 
    before the terminal read the previous keyboard buffer
  ~ 5 minutes, 2 line change
  ~ Algorithmic, fixed by checking if enter flag was already 1 before new line character 
    would be generated

X read goes beyond end of file and sometimes page fault
   (Alexandra)
  * indexing for buffer was wrong
  ~ 30 mins, 10 line change
  ~ algorithmic, was skipping parts of the buffer because of block offset
   (Alexandra)
--------------------

--------------------
DEBUG LOG 3.3:
X execute going past the end of the filename
  (Alexandra)
  * syscall.c line 120
  * causes read dentry fail because filename is wrong
  ~ 10 min, 2 lines change
  ~ Execute was being fed wrong input 
  (Jack)

X read data fail
  (Alexandra)
  * you must initialize buffer for read_data
  * right now I just did buf[4], we can change this later
  * (the PRGRM_IMG_START buffer works, could also change to be like this?)
  ~ 5 minutes, 1 line change
  (Alexandra)

X was boot looping, now page fault
  (Alexandra)
  * syscall.c line 219
  * after the function is done, the program gets lost and can't return to execute
  ~ 3 hours, 1 line change
  ~ EBP wasn't saved at right location in halt code
  (Jack)

X RTC virtual not main rtc functions
  (Ben)
  * rtc functions should default have virtualization in EFFECTS
  * might be causing issue that pingpong page faults
  ~ 5 mins, 50 line change
  ~ made virtualization code default for rtc
  (Kevin)

X Page fault on exit from base shell
  (Ben)
  * if type exit in base shell, page faults
  * probably issue with how we are halting base shell
  ~ 10 minutes, 2 line change
  ~ Switched re-executing shell back to halt
  (Ben)

X Pingpong Page faulting
  (Ben)
  * Probably either issue with rtc or read
  * issue is with open
  ~ 5-10 minutes, 2 line change
  ~ needed to use the new global file pointers
  (Alexandra)
--------------------

--------------------
DEBUG LOG 3.4:
X We cannot allow more than 3 shells running at same time
  (Ben)
  * Will need to add this constraint later
  ~ 10 minutes, 1 line change
  ~ Max amount of processes is 3 
  (Ben)

X getargs being filled with null
  (Jack)
  ~ 5 min, 1 line changed
  ~ Had to increment cmdHold when changing from filename to arguments.
  (Jack)

X 'ls' and 'syserr 3' break after running 'cat'
  (Alexandra)
  * bootblock just disappears from bbl entries after 'cat'
  * ls and syserr 3 fail because cannot find '.' (bbl) file
  ~ 30 mins, 2 line change
  ~ was initializing fentry bad in open_file
  (Alexandra)

X fish not doing anything
  (Ben)
  * fish does nothing when called
  ~ 30 mins, ~1 line change
  ~ Bound of validity never met, incorrect bounds
  (Kevin)

X fish page faults
  (Ben)
  * page faults when fish is called 
  ~ 30 mins, ~2 line change
  ~ TLB wasn't being flushed
  ~ index in page directory was 1 off
  (Kevin)
